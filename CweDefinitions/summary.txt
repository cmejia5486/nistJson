CWE-255;Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of credentials.
CWE-284;"Improper Access Control. The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as: Authentication, Authorization, Accountability. Attackers can compromise the security of the software by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc."
CWE-310;Weaknesses in this category are related to the use of cryptography.
CWE-119;Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data. 
CWE-200;Information Exposure. An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. Many information exposures are resultant (e.g. PHP script error revealing the full path of the program), but they can also be primary (e.g. timing discrepancies in cryptography). There are many different types of problems that involve information exposures. Their severity can range widely depending on the type of information that is revealed.
CWE-798;Use of Hard-coded Credentials. The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data. Hard-coded credentials typically create a significant hole that allows an attacker to bypass the authentication that has been configured by the software administrator. This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely.
CWE-264;Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay. A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the software makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes). Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.
CWE-89;"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'). The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data. This can be used to alter query logic to bypass security checks, or to insert additional statements that modify the back-end database, possibly including execution of system commands. SQL injection has become a common issue with database-driven web sites. The flaw is easily detected, and easily exploited, and as such, any site or software package with even a minimal user base is likely to be subject to an attempted attack of this kind. This flaw depends on the fact that SQL makes no real distinction between the control and data planes."
CWE-295;Improper Certificate Validation.  The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate. When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.
CWE-20;Improper Input Validation. The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.
CWE-287;Improper Authentication. When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct. 
CWE-22;Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
CWE-306;Missing Authentication for Critical Function. The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.
CWE-345;Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity. The software does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.  
CWE-19;Data Processing Errors. Weaknesses in this category are typically found in functionality that processes data. 
CWE-79;Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
CWE-352;Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.
CWE-346;Origin Validation Error. The software does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid. 
CWE-125;Out-of-bounds Read. The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash. A crash can occur when the code reads a variable amount of data and assumes that a sentinel exists to stop the read operation, such as a NUL in a string.
CWE-611;Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference. The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.
CWE-601;URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect'). A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks. An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.
CWE-434;Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type. The software allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment. 
CWE-254;7PK - Security Features. Software security is not security software. Here we're concerned with topics like authentication, access control, confidentiality, cryptography, and privilege management.
CWE-190;Integer Overflow or Wraparound. The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control. An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number. 
CWE-320;Key Management Errors. Weaknesses in this category are related to errors in the management of cryptographic keys.
CWE-319;The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.Many communication channels can be "sniffed" by attackers during data transmission. For example, network traffic can often be sniffed by any attacker who has access to a network interface. This significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by attackers.
CWE-326;Inadequate Encryption Strength. The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required. A weak encryption scheme can be subjected to brute force attacks that have a reasonable chance of succeeding using current attack methods and resources.
CWE-613;Insufficient Session Expiration. According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."
CWE-427;Uncontrolled Search Path Element. The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors. 
CWE-639;Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key. The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data. 
CWE-862;Missing Authorization. The software does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
CWE-754;Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions. The software does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the software.
CWE-112;Missing XML Validation. The software accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema. 
CWE-863;Incorrect Authorization. The software performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. 
CWE-787;Out-of-bounds Write. The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. 
others;Vulnerabilities that are not classified in the cve list
CWE-276;Incorrect Default Permissions (During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files).
CWE-312;Storage of sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.
CWE-347;Lack of verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data
CWE-918;Receiving of a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination
