Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

Most software licenses are designed to restrict your freedom to share and change the works. In contrast, the GNU General Public License guarantees your freedom to share and modify all versions of a program, ensuring it remains free software for all its users. This License applies to any work released by its authors under this scheme. You can apply it to your programs as well.

When we speak of free software, we refer to freedom, not price. The GNU General Public License ensures that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software, charge for them if you wish, receive source code or obtain it if you want, modify the software, or use pieces of it in new free programs.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying these rights or forcing you to surrender them. Therefore, if you distribute copies of the software or modify it, you must respect the freedom of others by providing the same rights you received.

For example, if you distribute copies of the program, whether for free or for a fee, you must provide recipients with the same freedoms, including access to the source code.
